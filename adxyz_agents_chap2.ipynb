    "1.1 Define in your own words intelligence, artificial intelligence, agent, rationality, logical reasoning. \n",
    "Intelligence is the ability to take information from external sources, and along with internal stored information, take actions which change the external environment in a way that appears to have a structure or pattern that can be observed and recognized by others.  For example, if a door is closed and locked, and a person tries to open it by reaching into their pocket and seeking a key that fits, this would be considered an act of intelligence.  By contrast, simply kicking the door down would not be considered intelligence, since it is wasteful of resources. \n",
    "Artificial Intelligence is simulating the intelligence of living beings by non-living machines, but not necessarily by duplicating the methods (which may be unknown).  The pattern of taking external input, processing it in some way to reach a choice, and then acting on that choice externally are the key elements to reproduce. \n",

    "Notes on Turing (1950):  In this paper, Alan Turing describes the \"Imitation Game\" which is what we now think of as the Turing test.  In his original version, there is the interregator, the test subject, and also a third player who is human, and tries to provide evidence of human responses to the interogator (probably to simulate a control-test experimental setup).  Other parts of the paper describe learning machines, reinforcement learning, and the characterization of \"thinking\" as being related to storage size.  At a storage size of 1Gbit or so, Turing believes machines will pass the \"Imitation Game\" test in that an interogator will be unable to distinguish between a human and machine.  The human brain, estimated at the time of this paper, was asserted to have approximately 10^10 to 10^15 bits of storage, which is 1GB to 100TB – this is a fairly wide range, but with current day technology, easily achievable either in the cloud or on native hardware."

    "In the general case, we would have a situation where you would need to include the time step and compare it to T in order to decide on an action.  Once the time step T is reached, any further action cannot change the performance measure, any action is acceptable.  However, before that time step is reached, the action taken must be such that the performance measure is maximized. \n",

    "Definition of a Rational Agent:  For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has. \n",
    "Assumptions: \n",
    "-a- The performance measure awards one point for each clean square at each time step, over a \"lifetime\" of 1000 time steps.  (Note:  The performance measure is assessed from the state of the entire environment, not agent, point of view) \n",
    "-b- The geography of the environment is known a priori (Figure 2.2), but the dirt distribution and initial location of the agent are not.  Clean squares stay clean and sucking cleans the current square.  The Left and Right actions move the agent outside the environment, in which  case the agent remains where it is. \n",
    "-c- The only available actions are Left, Right, and Suck. \n",
    "-d- The agent correctly perceives its location and whether that location contains dirt. \n",
    "Solution:   \n",
    "There are four possible environments that can arise as initial condition (not including the initial location of the agent, which will double the count)  \n",

    "For the following analysis, assume that the agent is always initially places in square A. \n",
    "For Case 1:  The maximum theoretical performance value is 2x1000=2000 points, since at each time step, both squares are clean, so we are awarded 1 point for each panel and the total time history is 1000.  The agent will reproduce this theoretical maximum, because it will merely oscillate between squares A and B. \n",
    "For Case 2:  The maximum theoretical performance value is also 2x1000=2000 points, since we assume that if there is dirt in square A, then it will be cleaned, and at the end of the time step, the evaluation of the measure will be based on two clean squares since we are assuming that our agent is in square A initially.  Our agent performs actions that will produce the same result. \n",
    "For Case 3:  The maximum theoretical performance value is (1+0) + 2*999=1999.  During the first time step, we only have one clean square, and the agent will have to move from A to B in order to clean square B.  Including and after the second time step, we have two clean squares and gain 2 points for each time step.  Our agent reproduces this action and thus will match the maximum possible performance. \n",
    "For Case 4:  The maximum theoretical performance value is (1+0) + (1+0)+2*998= 1998.  On the first time step, we have can only clean the first square A, thus only obtaining 1 points.  On the second time step, we move to square B, and only have the clean square A to give a point.  On the third and subsequent steps, we have both squares clean, and get a full two points each step.  The agent will match this theoretical performance by its actions.  \n",
    " \n",
    "B)  Describe a rational agent function for the case where each movement costs one point.  Does the corresponding agent program require internal state? \n",
    "A key observation is that once a given square is clean you don't want to waste points by moving back to it, so we need to remember whether or not a cell is clean. \n",

    "By this definition, as long as the agent selects an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence, it is rational.  If the percept sequence is something like [A, maybe dirty], there will be an action for this case that will attempt to maximize the known performance measure. \n",

Assume the worse case that the agent cannot detect whether the square is clean or not.  This becomes irrelevant because each time step, the agent will take the single action Suck and either clean the square if it is dirty, and get the point, or simply clean an already clean square, with no loss.  Under the given performance measure (which is awarding points for clean squares) this is optimal. \n",

Imagine a situation where a point is deducted for each move on the two square vacuum world, and one point is given for each clean square.  Once a square has been cleaned, the agent shouldn't return to it.  However, without this knowledge being stored, the agent is destined to repeatedly return to previously clean squares, which is not rational, given the fact that these precepts have already been observed.  This assumes that the reflex agent is restricted to observing only the current square it is on. "

    "3.1 Explain why problem formulation must follow goal formulation.  The goal (state) specifies the structure of the answer being sought by the agent.  For example, the goal might be \"have all the tiles in an 8-tile puzzle in the correct location starting from an arbitrary random arrangement.\"  This provides the framework that specifies the state space (arrangements tiles in an 8-tile puzzle), and also implies restrictions on how this can be accomplished (namely following the mechanics of how 8-til puzzles work, one-tile can be moved at a time into a blank, or alternatively, a blank can be moved in one of four directions from center, one of three on edge, one of two in a corner position. \n",

    "\n",
    "A) How large is the state space:  If we consider the state space to be the location of the robot on a discrete x-y grid consisting of N locations, then the state space will be 4*N, for each of the four directions the robot can be facing at each location. \n",
    "\n",
    "B) We change the problem so that the only place you can turn is at the intersection of two or more corridors, how big is the state space now?: Let M be the number of intersections of the type just mentioned.  Then, we would have a state space of 4*M.  Each state would have the form, <intersection_1, heading_north>, which would then yield the next possible state that is reachable in the search tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "C) From each point in the maze, we can move in any of the four directions until we reach a turning point, and this is the only action we need to do.  Reformulate the problem now.  Do we still need to keep track of the robot's orientation?  A state could be defined like this: \n",
